# HSM Server

## New Alert constructor has been added
Constructor blocks are divided into 2 parts: **Conditions** and **Actions**
### Condition blocks:
A set of events to perform certain actions. Condition block begins with block **If** and **Property** block that contsains the next options:
* **Value** - select this if you want to create an alert for Intereger or Double sensor value (this property is available only for Integer and Double sensors)
* **Min**, **Max**, **Mean**, **LastValue** - select this if you want to create an alert for bar sensor min, max, mean or last value (this property is available only for bar sensors)
* **Status** - select this if you want to create an alert for sensor status (this property is available for all sensors)

If you select property Value, Min, Max, Mean or LastValue, you should select **Operation** (arithmetic operations **>=**, **>**, **<**, **<>=**) and enter **Target** (numeric value to compare)

If you select property Status, you should select one of 3 available options: **is changed**, **is ðŸ”´ Error** or **is ðŸŸ¢ OK**

You can combine different conditions by pressing the plus button

### Actions blocks:
A set of events that are executed when certain conditions are met. You can add different types of actions by pressing the plus button or delete unnecessary action by pressing the cross button. There are the next actions:
* **Send notification** - select this if you want to receive telegram notification with custom **Comment template**. This is required action and comment template is also required (default value is $sensor $operation $target)
