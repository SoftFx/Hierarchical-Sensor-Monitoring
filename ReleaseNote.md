* Priority System -> DataCollector -> User
    * **System** - Can only change its own objects

* **Change to Ok** property has been added for Status.
* **Change to Error** property has been added for Status.
* New variable **$property** has been added.
* New varoable **$count** for Bar sensors has been added.
* $target for **Status OnChange** property returns sensor name instead guid.
* Aggregation has been fixed for Alert with different AlertState

## History
* **Last update** and **Aggregation count** columns have been added for sensors with **Aggregate data** setting

## Journal
* Initiator type has been added. (System, DataCollector, User)
* Records about change by parent for all **From parent** alerts have been added
* Never and Forever values have been added to Journal records (instead of None)

* Checkbox to change last value has been added

## Charts
* A button to display the nearest **Service status** as a background has been added
* A button to display the nearest **Service alive** as a background has been added
* Sensor TTL is displayed as gray dots on the graph

## Rest API
* New endpoint **/addOrUpdate** has been added. This endpoint allows you to configure any sensor through DataCollector
* New endpoint **/commands** has been added. Allows you to batch send commands to the server (*ex. /addOrUpdate*)

## Other
* View format for TimeSpan has been improved. (From 31d 0h 0m 0s -> 31 days)
* System has been added as initiator to Muted->Available update
* New predefined values 1 min and 5 min for TTL has been added

# HSM DataCollector v. 3.2.0

## Settings
* New setting **Module** has been added. The module is automatically inserted at the start of the paths of all collector sensors

## Sensor settings
* The user can configure all sensors through DataCollector. More information can be found [**here**](https://github.com/SoftFx/Hierarchical-Sensor-Monitoring/wiki/DataCollector-sensor-settings)
* The user can override all default sensors settings.  More information can be found [**here**](https://github.com/SoftFx/Hierarchical-Sensor-Monitoring/wiki/DataCollector-sensor-settings)
* New setting **Unit** (bytes, MB, GB and etc.) has been added to sensor settings

## Default sensors
* Description, alerts, ttl and other settings have been added for all default sensors
* New default sensor **Active disk time** has been added
* **Is need update** sensor has been removed. It's logic has been added as alert to **Last update** sensor

## Alerts API

How to use Alerts API examples can be found [**here**](https://github.com/SoftFx/Hierarchical-Sensor-Monitoring/wiki/DataCollector-sensor-settings)

## Bugfixing
