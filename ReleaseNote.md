# HSM Server

## New tab Journal has been added!

The log records information about who changed some properties and when. Journal saves 4 types of changes:

1. Metainfo changes (Description, Enable for Grafana, Muting)
2. Settings changes (TTL value, Cleanup section)
3. Alert changes (add/remove/update)
4. Sensor remove (only for nodes/products)

Journal has been added for all entities (Folders, Products, Nodes, Sensors). If entity includes some subnodes or sensors their journals merges on one tab and by default load only 100 last records for each sub entities. Also Journal tab includes paging and searching.
